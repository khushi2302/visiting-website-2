Built beginning in 1156, the sandstone citadel stands guard atop a triangular hill, complete with three layers of walls, four imposing gates and 99 turrets. Together with five other majestic forts in Rajasthan, Jaisalmer is a <a href="https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/247" target="_blank">Unesco World Heritage site</a>, and the striking honey hues of the yellow sandstone used in building this stronghold have inspired its moniker, the Golden City.</p><p>However, the citadel is more than just a significant historical and architectural landmark: more than 800 years after it was built, some 2,000 to 4,000 descendants of the castle’s earliest inhabitants continue to live inside its fortified walls, rent-free, as their ancestors were given the land by local kings in return for their services to the kingdom.</p><p>Today, not only is Jaisalmer the last inhabited ancient fortress in India, but it serves as something of a living monument, where life goes on among the narrow lanes and crowded courtyards in much the same manner as it did in the 12th Century.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="article-body__image-text article-body__image-text--landscape"><div id="travel/article/20190528-a-unesco-castle-where-families-live-rent-free-p07bk2j0"><div><picture><source media="(min-width:1200px)" srcSet="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1600x900/p07bk2j0.webp" type="image/webp"/><source media="(min-width:1200px)" srcSet="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1600x900/p07bk2j0.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><source media="(min-width:880px)" srcSet="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p07bk2j0.webp" type="image/webp"/><source media="(min-width:880px)" srcSet="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p07bk2j0.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><source media="(min-width:576px)" srcSet="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p07bk2j0.webp" type="image/webp"/><source media="(min-width:576px)" srcSet="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p07bk2j0.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><source media="(min-width:224px)" srcSet="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p07bk2j0.webp" type="image/webp"/><source media="(min-width:224px)" srcSet="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p07bk2j0.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><img draggable="false" title="The medieval fortress of Jaisalmer rises more than 20 storeys from the dusty landscape like a golden sandcastle (Credit: Michele Burgess/Alamy)" src="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p07bk2j0.jpg" alt="The medieval fortress of Jaisalmer rises more than 20 storeys from the dusty landscape like a golden sandcastle (Credit: Michele Burgess/Alamy)" id=""/></picture><div class="inline-image__description b-reith-sans-font inline-image__description--desktop"><div class="text-summary"><p class="text-summary__text text-summary__text--grey text-summary__text--left">The medieval fortress of Jaisalmer rises more than 20 storeys from the dusty landscape like a golden sandcastle (Credit: Michele Burgess/Alamy)</p></div></div></div></div></div><div><div class="body-text-card b-reith-sans-font"><div class="body-text-card__text body-text-card__text--travel body-text-card__text--flush-text"><div><p><strong>You may also be interested in:</strong><br />• <a href="http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20180821-malana-a-himalayan-village-shrouded-in-myth" target="_blank">The descendants of Alexander the Great?</a><br />• <a href="http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20180606-the-worlds-highest-post-office" target="_blank">Where post is delivered at 4,440m</a><br />• <a href="http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20180308-a-ghost-island-in-the-middle-of-the-indian-ocean" target="_blank">A ghost island in the Indian Ocean</a></p><p>Vimal Kumar Gopa’s family has been living inside the fortress for more than 700 years, and the 44-year-old manages a textile gallery from his small Kundpada home. Historically, the neighbourhood has only been home to members of the priestly Brahmin caste, who worked as teachers and advisors to the local kings who ruled Jaisalmer from the 12th Century until as recently as the mid-1900s, and were given homes inside the citadel. Today, seven centuries and 23 generations later, Gopa’s extended Brahmin family owns 42 homes inside these ancient walls.</p><p>“Inside the fort, people having the same surname usually come from one family and live in the same neighbourhood,” Gopa said. Apart from Brahmins, the other dominant community living inside Jaisalmer’s fort is the Rajputs, a clan of northern Indian Hindu warriors who were responsible for the safety of the city that surrounds the citadel, as well as the walled fortress.

Between the 16th and 18th Centuries, the kingdom flourished as an important stop on the Silk Road trading route that connected Europe with China via India, Afghanistan, Turkey and Egypt. Caravans of merchants and traders from the East, laden with bundles of silks, precious stones, spices, teas and whiffs of opium hanging in their wake would stop at one of Jaisalmer’s small inns with open courtyards seeking food, water and a place to sleep for the night. The local rulers prospered from the travellers’ stays, and wealthy city merchants built mansions (known as <a href="http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20160311-a-crumbling-birthplace-of-billionaires" target="_blank">havelis</a>), temples and inns both inside and outside Jaisalmer’s fortified walls.</p><p>Hundreds of years later, the only reminders of the area’s Silk Road significance are the abandoned villages, stone markers and dilapidated fortresses scattered across the barren desert landscape. Yet, the Golden City’s twisting lanes and turreted sandstone walls still lure caravans of visitors to its many hotels and restaurants. The desert winds now blow in camera-toting tourists by the busloads rather than merchants on camelback, but the city remains a stunning sandstone outpost where generations of residents have catered to travellers for centuries.</p><p>Today, the Jaisalmer fort is filled with a jumble of small teashops and cafes, guesthouses and homes, and temples and boutiques crammed against one another. Locals, particularly those living inside the fortress, continue to earn money from tourists. Some run restaurants serving simple mezze platters, while others sell exquisite handbags made of camel leather. Shopkeepers call out to passers-by to come in and inspect their flamboyant turbans, embroidered tapestries and ‘magic Viagra bedsheets’ said to inspire fertility. “No charge for looking, madam,” one called out from his plastic chair perched outside the shop.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="article-body__image-text article-body__image-text--landscape"><div id="travel/article/20190528-a-unesco-castle-where-families-live-rent-free-p07bk2g2"><div><picture><source media="(min-width:1200px)" srcSet="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1600x900/p07bk2g2.webp" type="image/webp"/><source media="(min-width:1200px)" srcSet="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1600x900/p07bk2g2.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><source media="(min-width:880px)" srcSet="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p07bk2g2.webp" type="image/webp"/><source media="(min-width:880px)" srcSet="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p07bk2g2.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><source media="(min-width:576px)" srcSet="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p07bk2g2.webp" type="image/webp"/><source media="(min-width:576px)" srcSet="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p07bk2g2.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><source media="(min-width:224px)" srcSet="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p07bk2g2.webp" type="image/webp"/><source media="(min-width:224px)" srcSet="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p07bk2g2.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><img draggable="false" title="Today, 2,000 to 4,000 descendants of the castle’s earliest inhabitants continue to live inside its fortified walls, rent-free (Credit: Patanjali Somayaji)" src="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p07bk2g2.jpg" alt="Today, 2,000 to 4,000 descendants of the castle’s earliest inhabitants continue to live inside its fortified walls, rent-free (Credit: Patanjali Somayaji)" id=""/></picture><div class="inline-image__description b-reith-sans-font inline-image__description--desktop"><div class="text-summary"><p class="text-summary__text text-summary__text--grey text-summary__text--left">Today, 2,000 to 4,000 descendants of the castle’s earliest inhabitants continue to live inside its fortified walls, rent-free (Credit: Patanjali Somayaji)</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="article-body__pull-quote"><blockquote class="inline-quote b-font-family-serif b-font-weight-300 inline-quote--travel"><h2 class="simple-header b-reith-sans-font b-font-family-serif b-font-weight-300 simple-header--serif-light-italic simple-p-tag--medium simple-p-tag--quote">The entire fort is one family</h2></blockquote></div><div><div class="body-text-card b-reith-sans-font"><div class="body-text-card__text body-text-card__text--travel body-text-card__text--flush-text"><div><p>However, despite the thousands of visitors who pass through here every day, the fortress remains a tightknit society. Outside many of Jaisalmer’s homes, cheery paintings announce forthcoming weddings among the castle’s residents. The paintings list the names of the groom and bride along with the date of the marriage, usually under an auspicious symbol such as a figure of the elephant god Ganesha, who is also the god of new beginnings. According to Gopa, there is no need for formal invitations within this small, fortified community.</p><p>“The entire fort is one family,” Gopa said. “The boundaries begin and end with the main gate known as Akhrey Prol that separates the town from us. Whether it is a marriage or a death, all of us come together to observe it.” Purohit also added to this, saying, “A couple of years [ago], when my mother had a heart attack, neither my brother [nor] I was at home, but my neighbours took her to the hospital. This ‘harmony’ is what I like most about living here, and it has always been this way in this community for centuries.”</p></div></div></div></div><div class="article-body__image-text article-body__image-text--landscape"><div id="travel/article/20190528-a-unesco-castle-where-families-live-rent-free-p07bk2kt"><div><picture><source media="(min-width:1200px)" srcSet="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1600x900/p07bk2kt.webp" type="image/webp"/><source media="(min-width:1200px)" srcSet="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1600x900/p07bk2kt.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><source media="(min-width:880px)" srcSet="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p07bk2kt.webp" type="image/webp"/><source media="(min-width:880px)" srcSet="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p07bk2kt.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><source media="(min-width:576px)" srcSet="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p07bk2kt.webp" type="image/webp"/><source media="(min-width:576px)" srcSet="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p07bk2kt.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><source media="(min-width:224px)" srcSet="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p07bk2kt.webp" type="image/webp"/><source media="(min-width:224px)" srcSet="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p07bk2kt.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><img draggable="false" title="Many Hindu and Jain temples inside Jaisalmer have remained the same for centuries and are still popular gathering places (Credit: Charukesi Ramadurai)" src="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p07bk2kt.jpg" alt="Many Hindu and Jain temples inside Jaisalmer have remained the same for centuries and are still popular gathering places (Credit: Charukesi Ramadurai)" id=""/></picture><div class="inline-image__description b-reith-sans-font inline-image__description--desktop"><div class="text-summary"><p class="text-summary__text text-summary__text--grey text-summary__text--left">Many Hindu and Jain temples inside Jaisalmer have remained the same for centuries and are still popular gathering places (Credit: Charukesi Ramadurai)</p></div></div></div></div></div><div><div class="body-text-card b-reith-sans-font"><div class="body-text-card__text body-text-card__text--travel body-text-card__text--flush-text"><div><p>From the citadel’s main gate, a winding path lined by shops selling metal jewellery and beaded handicrafts greets travellers. Residents on their motorbikes and auto-rickshaws carefully weave their way up the path, honking through a sea of pedestrians. Jaisalmeri women in flowing skirts and colourful blouses, heads covered with bright <em>dupatta</em> scarves, carry prayer offerings filled with fresh flowers and aromatic incense sticks to the temples inside the fort.</p><p>One of the lanes up on the hillock leads to the central Dusshera Chowk square and the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/category/Community-Museum/Baa-ri-haveli-jaisalmer-cultural-center-and-Museum-106686792701446/" target="_blank">Baa Ri Haveli</a>, a 450-year-old mansion-turned-museum showcasing artefacts from everyday life in the fort from the 15th Century to the present. Walking through the dozens of tiny rooms filled with misshapen coins, ancient maps, fading sepia photographs, cooking utensils, ornate turbans and other remnants of the past, what struck me is how much of this history still lives on in these lanes.</p><p>Brightly coloured cloth turbans, similar to the faded ones on display, can still be seen on the heads of fort residents, while traditional kitchens still use the same brass and bronze plates and pans. Gopa had described how <a href="http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20130325-indias-holy-festival-of-colours" target="_blank">Holi</a> (a Hindu festival of colours) and <a href="http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20121105-indias-festival-of-lights" target="_blank">Diwali</a> (a festival of lights) were celebrated communally in much the same fashion as they had been hundreds of years ago – just as the daily worship rituals in the numerous Hindu and Jain temples inside Jaisalmer’s walls have remained the same over time. Today, this museum serves as a testament to the citadel’s proud history, but restoring the ancient building was no easy feat.</p><p>“The mansion itself was in disrepair,” said the museum’s manager, Rakesh Vyas, who has lived inside the Baa Ri Haveli mansion his whole life and is a direct descendent of the original family who owned it. Vyas described the long and painstaking process of restoration and the compilation of these artefacts. “We didn’t have any support from the government or anyone else,” he said.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="article-body__image-text article-body__image-text--landscape"><div id="travel/article/20190528-a-unesco-castle-where-families-live-rent-free-p07bk2bh"><div><picture><source media="(min-width:1200px)" srcSet="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1600x900/p07bk2bh.webp" type="image/webp"/><source media="(min-width:1200px)" srcSet="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1600x900/p07bk2bh.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><source media="(min-width:880px)" srcSet="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p07bk2bh.webp" type="image/webp"/><source media="(min-width:880px)" srcSet="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p07bk2bh.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><source media="(min-width:576px)" srcSet="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p07bk2bh.webp" type="image/webp"/><source media="(min-width:576px)" srcSet="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p07bk2bh.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><source media="(min-width:224px)" srcSet="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p07bk2bh.webp" type="image/webp"/><source media="(min-width:224px)" srcSet="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p07bk2bh.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><img draggable="false" title="The fortress is now a protected heritage monument and its residents are not allowed to sell their property to an outsider or alter their facades (Credit: Patanjali Somayaji)" src="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p07bk2bh.jpg" alt="The fortress is now a protected heritage monument and its residents are not allowed to sell their property to an outsider or alter their facades (Credit: Patanjali Somayaji)" id=""/></picture><div class="inline-image__description b-reith-sans-font inline-image__description--desktop"><div class="text-summary"><p class="text-summary__text text-summary__text--grey text-summary__text--left">The fortress is now a protected heritage monument and its residents are not allowed to sell their property to an outsider or alter their facades (Credit: Patanjali Somayaji)</p></div></div></div></div></div><div><div class="body-text-card b-reith-sans-font"><div class="body-text-card__text body-text-card__text--travel body-text-card__text--flush-text"><div><p>This governmental lack of interest is not particularly surprising, Gopa later explained.

And while the ASI has mandated that no fort resident can sell his property to an outsider or alter the facade in any way, financial support for the maintenance of the fort, particularly its private spaces, has not been forthcoming.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="article-body__pull-quote"><blockquote class="inline-quote b-font-family-serif b-font-weight-300 inline-quote--travel"><h2 class="simple-header b-reith-sans-font b-font-family-serif b-font-weight-300 simple-header--serif-light-italic simple-p-tag--medium simple-p-tag--quote">Life is changing for us in many ways, but we hope that... our children and their children will also be able to live here</h2></blockquote></div><div><div class="body-text-card b-reith-sans-font"><div class="body-text-card__text body-text-card__text--travel body-text-card__text--flush-text"><div><p>It is not only the mansions, but the fort itself that is in danger of ruin. It is built on soft sedimentary rock and has an ancient drainage system that has been seeping steadily and directly into the foundations of the fort for many years now. All this has been made worse by uncontrolled construction and repair activity inside the fort, which means that many parts of the sandstone walls have crumbled. This magnificent fortress may have weathered the elements and survived multiple attacks by invading armies for more than eight centuries, but its future remains uncertain.</p><p>As Gopa said with a touch of wistfulness, “Of course, life is changing for us in many ways, but we hope that, just like our forefathers, our children and their children will also be able to live here.”</p><p><em>Join more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on </em><a href="https://www.facebook.com/BBCTravel/" target="_blank">Facebook</a><em>, or follow us on </em><a href="https://twitter.com/BBC_Travel" target="_blank">Twitter</a><em> and </em><a href="https://www.instagram.com/bbc_travel/" target="_blank">Instagram</a><em>.</em></p><p><em>If you liked this story, </em><a href="http://pages.emails.bbc.com/subscribe/?ocid=ear.bbc.email.we.email-signup" target="_blank">sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter</a><em> called "The Essential List".

Some historians posit that this could be because Etruscans believed life continued after death and the vie cave were pathways to the afterlife. \"Etruscans believed that the trees were gods, they believed that the rivers were gods, and the main important gods were underground,\" Ronca said. \"So probably the idea of digging vie cave through the rock was a way to connect with these gods, but we are not sure about that.\"\u003C\u002Fp\u003E"},"cardType":"Body","iFrameType":"","id":"travel\u002Farticle\u002F20220922-tuscanys-mysterious-cave-roads-4"},{"bodyHtml":{"assets":[]},"cardType":"Image","iFrameType":"","image":[],"imageAlignment":"centre","imageOrientation":"landscape","id":"travel\u002Farticle\u002F20220922-tuscanys-mysterious-cave-roads-5"},{"bodyHtml":{"assets":[],"html":"\u003Cp class=\"Default\"\u003EInterestingly, the artefacts also suggest that women and men were equal in Etruscan society, which is different than how the Romans behaved: in sculptures and paintings, women are depicted as being not only welcome but active participants at banquets and social gatherings; inscriptions indicate that \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.nytimes.com\u002F1972\u002F12\u002F30\u002Farchives\u002Fetruscan-women-had-womens-lib.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003Ewomen could inherit property and kept matronymic names\u003C\u002Fa\u003E (Roman women took their father's or husband's name); and the \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.museoetru.it\u002Fworks\u002Fsarcophagus-of-the-spouses\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ESarcophagus of the Spouses\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, found in the Etruscan necropolis in Cerveteri, shows a man and woman held in equal status.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp class=\"Default\"\u003E\"Roman women were just the mother of the family &ndash;&nbsp;they had lots of power, but inside the house,\" Ronca said. \"On the contrary in the Etruscan world, females were almost [the same] as men; they could rule a family, they could rule a town.

On the small Hebridean island of Eriskay, I followed a single road through a stark, treeless landscape dominated by the greys and deep greens of its rocky slopes. To the north, a sparse scattering of sturdy houses were braced against the wind while a stretch of white-sand beach brightened the island's western edge. If Eriskay appeared a rugged place, it was an appearance that seemed to reflect its endurance against hardships wrought by both nature and history.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EEriskay resembles an asterisk at the end of a string of bigger islands: North Uist; Benbecula; and South Uist. Only 2.5 miles long and 1.5 miles wide, Eriskay is the final link in the chain of causeways that tether the islands together, its connection to South Uist completed just 20 years ago. Long accessible only by sea, road access stabilised its then-drastically declining population &ndash; islanders can now work or study off-island while still living on Eriskay &ndash; and eased travel for visitors. Yet that long isolation had its benefits. It protected such idiosyncratic attractions as the Eriskay Pony, one of the UK's oldest and rarest breeds and the last remnant of Scotland's native horse. As I walked, I spotted a herd grazing high on the hill.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBy carrying peat and seaweed on their backs, the small, hardy and docile ponies were once crucial to croft work.

The consequences, following defeat the next year at the Battle of Culloden, were disastrous for the Highlands and Islands. Britain terrorised them through indiscriminate killing; dismantled social structures by breaking up clans; and attempted to erase cultural identity through banning the wearing of tartan and suppressing the use of Gaelic.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe second event that has long defined the island occurred in 1941, when the SS&nbsp;Politician, carrying some 22,000 cases of fine malt whisky in its hold, struck submerged sandbanks&nbsp;off Eriskay. Having first helped to rescue the crew, the islanders soon set about liberating the whisky in the belief that the cargo was theirs under the \"rules of salvage\". UK Customs and Excise took a different view. Islanders' homes were raided and several were tried for illegal salvaging, smuggling and black market selling of goods and sentenced to prison.

But after the Meiji Restoration (about 150 years ago), people from mainland Japan started emigrating to Hokkaido as Japan colonised the northernmost island, and discriminatory practices such as the 1899 Hokkaido Former Aborigines Protection Act displaced the Ainu from their traditional lands to the mountainous barren area in the island&rsquo;s centre.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very ugly story,&rdquo; said Professor Kunihiko Yoshida, law professor at Hokkaido University.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EForced into agriculture, they were no longer able to fish for salmon in their rivers and hunt deer on their land, Yoshida said.
